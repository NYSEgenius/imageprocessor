# Image Processor

A simple Java-based image processing program with a graphical user interface.  
This project demonstrates working with 2D arrays, object-oriented design, and GUI development in Java (Swing).

## Features
- Load and display images
- Represent images at the pixel level (`Pixel` and `Image` classes)
- Perform image manipulations (e.g., grayscale, color adjustments, etc.)
- GUI for visualization and interaction (`ImagePanel`, `ImageProcessorFrame`)
- Organized, modular code demonstrating OOP principles

## Project Structure
- **Image.java** — Represents an image as a grid of `Pixel` objects  
- **Pixel.java** — Encapsulates individual pixel data (e.g., RGB values)  
- **ImagePanel.java** — Custom Swing component for rendering images  
- **ImageProcessorFrame.java** — Main application window (GUI setup)  
- **ImageProcessorProgram.java** — Entry point for running the program  

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-processor.git
   cd image-processor
